// ### MVP

// #### Episode 1


// const scenario = {
//   murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
//   room: 'Library',
//   weapon: 'Rope'
// };

// const declareMurderer = function() {
//   return `The murderer is ${scenario.murderer}.`;
// }

// const verdict = declareMurderer();
// console.log(verdict);


// the murderer is Miss Scarlet, because the object scenario is a global scope. It can be accessed by function and because she is the only
// murderer named here, it can only be her


// #### Episode 2


const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// The murderer is Professor Plum or it would come back with an error, because a const variable cannot be reassigned with another value.
// It cannot be Mrs Peacock, lucky her.

#### Episode 3


let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const declareMurderer = function() {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();
console.log('First Verdict: ', firstVerdict);

const secondVerdict = `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);

// First verdict would be that Mrs Peacock is the murderer, because the variable takes in the variable which is within the function 
// with her name.
// Second verdict is Professor Plum because the variable can use the one defined globally.

#### Episode 4


let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
}

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);
